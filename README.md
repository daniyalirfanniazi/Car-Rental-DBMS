Car Rental Database Management System (DBMS)

This project implements a Car Rental Database Management System using SQLite. The system is designed to manage core car rental operations such as customers, vehicles, rentals, payments, employees, and maintenance records.

Project Overview
The database is designed using a relational model with proper table structures, primary keys, and foreign keys to maintain data integrity. Sample data is inserted, and multiple SQL queries are used to retrieve meaningful information for management purposes.

Project Components
ERD: Entity Relationship Diagram representing the database design
DDL: SQL scripts to create database tables
DML: SQL scripts to insert, update, and delete data
SQL Queries: Queries using joins, aggregate functions, grouping, and filtering
